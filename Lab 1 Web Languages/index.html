     <!-- Hey, welcome to the first lab -->
     <!-- First of all, feel free to mess around with the code in this fiddle to your heart's content. Your changes will not be saved so you don't have to worry about that and it is easier to learn when you are trying things first-hand. -->
     
     
     <!-- These right here are HTML comments. Yes, they have weird syntax, but there's nothing we can do about that -->
     
     
     
     <!-- HTML follows a very easy system: <tagName>Content</tagName> where the first tagName opens a tag and the /tagname closes the tag.-->
     <!-- To get started we need a boiler plate. You can google "HTML boiler plate" and easily get the following: -->
     
     <!-- <html>
       <head>
         <title>title</title>
       </head>
       <body>
       
       </body>
     </html> -->
     
     <!-- Let's start from top to bottom. The html tag is just what determines where our code starts and ends. There's no way around this tag, every html document must start and end with the html tag. -->
     <!-- The head tag is used to write things that are not going to be seen in the page. These include linking files and frameworks. We'll be using it a little later to show how to link a CSS file to our HTML file -->
     <!--  -->
     <!-- The title tag is not necessary but is always nice to have. It gives a title to the web page that is displayed on the browser's tab. As previously stated, this tag is not seen in the page itself, so it is included inside the head tag. -->
     <!-- Finally we get to the main part of the boilerplate: the body. Everything that you see in a webpage is inside the body tag. -->
     
     <!-- Let's now get to writing some code! -->
     
     <!-- HTML boilerplate: -->
     <html>
     
       <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <title>About Me</title>
         
         <!--  The title is not displayed while using JSFiddle but it is still a nice touch to include it. -->
     
         <!--     Load in files here -->
         <!-- By loading in files we mean that you will load in your CSS, JavaScript, Custom Fonts, etc. In fiddle the JavaScript and CSS are automatically loaded but we will have to do this ourselves when we begin making our files locally. We will cover this in our Bootstrap Info Session -->

        <!--    First, we'll look at the header (h) tag. it goes from 1 to 6, 1 being the biggest and 6 being the smallest. The way they work is they just take any text inside of them and format it as a title -->
         <h1>Intro To HTML and CSS</h1>
         <h2>I am a header 2. I am smaller than h1.</h2>
         <h3>I am an h3. I'm in the middle!</h3>
         <h4>Smaller headers aren't used as much.</h4>
         <h5>But it is still good to know that they exist.</h5>
         <h6>I am h6. I am the smallest header.</h6>
     
         <!--     hr just prints a line through the page. I am using it to separate topics. hr is one of the few tags that doesn't have to be closed, since there is no way for us to write content inside of it! -->
         <hr>
     
         <!--  Now if we think of our web page as a book, right below a title would be text, ant that is exactly what the paragraph (p) tag is for! It helps us write normal, not title text. -->
     
         <p> I am a paragraph. I just show plain text.</p>
     
         <!--   If you were adventurous, you may have notices that just writing text without any tag will also print plain text: -->
     
         I am not a paragraph but I can show plain text too!
     
         <!--   So what even is the point of a paraghrph? There are two reasons why we should use paragraphs instead of text without tags. First, such text cannot be eddited by CSS or JavaScript (more on that later). Second, the paragraph tag includes the properties of a paragraph. This means that it will leave the appropriate spacing as you would when writing different paraghraphs. -->
         <p>This is paragraph number one.</p>
         <p>And this is paragraph number two!
         
         
         I have many returns in the code but they don't show up on the page since I am inside the same paragraph tag. I will either need a new pareagraph tag or a break tag (br) to have a return.
         <!-- This is a break tag and it requires no closing tag it is essentially just a return-->
         <br>
         See, I am still in the same paragraph but on another line
         </p>
     
         This is untagged text number one.
         This is untagged text number two.

         <!--   To create a list, we begin by using the ul tag. This will tell our webpage that we want to begin a list. But how do we add our bullet points? We use il for that! -->

         <strong>CSS is used to stylize your webpage</strong> and can help set it apart from others that may have a similar structure. Many websites use very similar structures but have very different designs for this reason. At the very basic level, CSS can modify fonts, text size and color, borders, margins, and padding. At a more advanced level, CSS can add hover or click effects, transitions, and complex animations. 
     <br><br>    
     Some helpful design tips is to draw out what you want in advance and then after creating you structure, implement that design in CSS. Be sure to pick a color palette and fonts you plan to use and keep the same style throughout. Keep advanced elements, transitions, and pictures at a minimum to add emphasis to them without slowing down your webpage load time.
